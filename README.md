2. Multiple Levels: Progress through different levels with increasing difficulty.
3. Enemies and Hazards: Avoid or defeat various enemies and environmental hazards.
4. Collectibles: Gather items for points or special abilities.
5. Basic UI: A simple user interface to start the game, pause, and display score/lives.
